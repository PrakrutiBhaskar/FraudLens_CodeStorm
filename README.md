# FraudLens_CodeStorm
FraudLens is a lightweight fake-app detection system designed for the CodeStorm hackathon.
It focuses on identifying counterfeit / impersonator Android applications that mimic trusted brands (banks, UPI apps, wallets, e-commerce, etc.).

The system analyzes data from Google Play Store or APK mirror sites (mocked or scraped), extracts risk signals, and gives each app a Fraud Risk Score, along with evidence and an auto-generated takedown email.
